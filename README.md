# HR-Attrition-SQL-Analysis
This project is all about exploring employee attrition — or simply, why people leave a company — using SQL. I wanted to understand what drives turnover, which departments are most affected, and how different factors like job role, satisfaction, and salary influence attrition.

It’s a hands-on project that takes a raw HR dataset and turns it into meaningful insights through data cleaning, normalization, and SQL analysis.
